            Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should
            look at the terms regularly. If revision is material, we will try to provide at least
            [SPECIFY] days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material
            change will be determined at our sole discretion, addressing new functions for a Service
            or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. you do not agree with
            the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.
            If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms
            will control for that conflict.

            These terms control the relationship between PLUMAR and you. They do not create any
            third-party beneficiary rights.
            If you do not comply with these terms, and we don't act right away, this doesn't mean
            that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).
            If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other
            terms. The courts in some countries will not apply [STATE] law to some types of
            disputes. If you reside in one of those countries, then where [STATE] law is excluded
            from applying, your country's laws will apply to such disputes related to these terms.
